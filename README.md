# Todo APP

# Introduction

Project 2 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: JavaScript Essentials

This Todo App website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is interactive and user-friendly, allowing the user to add todos to a list. They can later on sort the todo list according to thier preferences and edit or delete todo items.

# Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To provide a Todo APP that users can use to write up things they have to do.
* To provide the function of adding a date to state the due dates for when the todos should be completed.
* To edit, delete and sort the todos.
* To make it possible to save the information on the local storage of the users device.


# User Experience - UX

## User Stories

#### New User:  
* As a new user, I am looking for a Todo App to write my todos.  
* As a new user, I would like to be able to edit, delete and sort my todos.
* As a new user, I want to be able to navigate the site easily to store and manipulate my information.  


#### Returning User:
* As a returning user, I would like to access my todos again.
* As a returning user, I would like to add, edit, delete and sort my todos.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and interactive for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

# Design

## Color Scheme

![Colors](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714840483/Todo/todo2024/Extract-palette-from-image-Coolors_arqj2n.png)
* The color scheme of the website was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) from the background picture. 
* Different shades of purple were used to match the background. 

## Typography
Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. 
We chose to use the font:'montserrat', sans-serif as it is user friendly.
![Fonts](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714840483/Todo/todo2024/Montserrat-Google-Fonts_lkgc6u.png)

## Imagery
The background image used within the site has been chosen because it is a calming landscape, which does not interfer with the todo app located ontop of it.

# Features

The website is comprised of the Home page with a Heading and then 3 main sections:

## The Input Section 

![The Input Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714841447/Todo-2024_dunz2x.png)

The input section has four sections. There are two input fields, one for text with a placeholder saying "Add your Todo" so that the user is clearly notified to add thier todo in that field. 
The second input area indicates to the user to add a date. They can type the date using the given format as a placeholder. Alternatively there is an icon to the right of this input area indicating a calender. When the user clicks on the icon a drop down calender is shown, which they can use to choose thier date. 
Then there are two buttons to choose from to indicate if the todo is personal or for business. The business botton is per default already chosen. The user has to toggle between the two buttons to make thier choice.
At the bottom there is a big Add button to indicate the submit button. If it is clicked and there are no inputs in the sections above it, then error messages appear for both the date and todo input fields.

## The Filter Section

This section has 5 buttons to sort the todo list according to:
### Date: 
After the user clicks this button, the todo list will be sorted according to the date.

![Date](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714841445/date_wzyfxg.png)

### Pending:
After the user clicks this button, the todo list will be sorted with the pending todos shown first.

![Pending](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714841445/pending_l4irty.png)

### Revert:
After the user clicks this button, the todo list is reverted to how it originally was before clicking any of the sort buttons. Any changes like edits, deleted todos, newly added todos or checked or unchecked todos that are made and saved on the local storage will be shown. In short the revert button shows the current status of the todos in the local storage. 

### Business:
After the user clicks this button, the todo list is sorted with the business todos first.

### Personal:
After the user clicks this button, the todo list is sorted with the personal todos first.

## The Todo List Section

This section shows the created todos. If the user adds a new todo, it appears at the end of the list. 
There are 5 display sections of each todo:

### Top right:
In the individual displayed todos, there is a checkcircle at the top right. The circle has a border and a center. When the circle is unchecked this is shown as either a pink border for personal or blue border for business todos.  If the circle is checked to indicate that the todo is complete, the center gets the same color as the border. At the same instance the text of the todo gets a line-through and the text font color changes to grey. 

![Checked](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714841440/checkmark_aqx2oi.png)

### Content left section:
Here is where the title, content or description of the todo is displayed. On larger devices where the hover feature is active, the background color changes to a lighter purple to highlight the section for the user. 
As mentioned above, when the todo is checked complete, there is a line through the text and a font color change to grey to indicate the complete status of the todo.
When the edit icon is clicked, the focus of the curser pointer moves to the text to indicate that the user can edit the text in that field. When the user clicks again in the text field it changes to a lighter purple color. By moving out of the text field the edited text is then saved.
It is possible to edit even checked text. The line through and font color of grey remain as features even during the editing process.  

### Date section:
Here the chosen date is displayed of the todo.

### Actions buttons at the left buttom section:
On the left is the edit button with a hover feature that changes the background to a dark grey when hovered over (on larger devices). When the edit icon is clicked, the focus of the curser goes directly to the title or description area of the todo to notify the user that they can edit the text in that area. 
On the right of the edit icon is a delete icon depicted by a trash can and having a bright crimson color to alert the user that if this button is clicked the todo gets deleted and canÂ´t be retrieved again.

### Scrollbar:
The scrollbar appears on the far righthand side of the whole todo list after a maximal height of 300px is reached. The color changes from an off white to a light grey when the curser drags the scrollbar. On larger devices the thickness of the scrollbar increases when hovered over.


## Future Features

### More Edit Functions

* It would be very beneficial to be able to edit and change not only the description of the todo, but also the date and change the checkcircle incase the wrong category was initally choses as the business icon is per default choses.
* When the edit icon is clicked on a checked todo, a popup message should appear to ask the user if they want to make changes or not. Then if the user chooses to make changes, they should be prompted to uncheck the todo so that the text is no longer grey or have a line-through. Afterwards they can choose to check the todo or leave it as unchecked.

  ## Functionality
* All links have been hovered and clicked to ensure accessibility.
* Webpage loads correctly on all device screen sizes.
* The background image loads as intended.
* All the buttons are working correctly and provide the function results that they were built for.
* The todos are saved on the local storage of the computers and can be re-assessed when the user returns to the site after exiting it.

   ## Bugs
* My program had a bug in the javascript and wouldnÂ´t run because in the DisplayTodos function i was not passing the todos into the function. I had to work with the tutor support to debug this problem.

![After the correction](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714848887/Screenshot_2024-05-04_124652_lkfh4d.png)

* I had an overlay in the vertical access of my todo list and i had to fix the issue by adding some code in the css file line 185 and set the overflow-y to scroll.

![Before](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1714848959/overflow_rwpy3i.png)

* I needed tutor support to help me with the filter functions because after the arrow function i was using todolist.sort((a, b) =>.... instead of todos.sort((a,b) =>....

* I needed to tweek the filter functions many times until they worked the way i wanted them to work. There are still bugs. Like if you sort the list first by date and then by pending , it keeps the original sort by date and then with the new function of pending todos first, which means the pending todos will appear on the top of the list sorted by dte and the completed will appear below sorted by date. If you click the pending button before any other sort button, it will only sort per pending and not any other criteria. The same goes for the other buttons as well. 
* Below are screenshots i made while i was coding for the personal todos firt function. I figured out in the end that the last return function (return a.category > b.category ? -1 : 1;) was sorting alphabetically and since "b" for businees comes before "p", it would always return the business todos first until i changed comparison sign from < to >. Well at least that is how i explained it to myself.
